# My Nvim Config

repo to show my nvim plugins, remappings and all that stuff. Hopefully this repo will be merge to a dotfiles repo at some point.

> :warning: **This config allows a basic version of bootstraping.** However, the first time you run this, only some configurations will load since all plugins are being download. When opening neovim again, everything should work fine ( nvim-treesitter configs might take a while to load the second time you open neovim with this config but after that it works fine )

> :warning: \*\*be sure to install the needed formatters(stylua)
