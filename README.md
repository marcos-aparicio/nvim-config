# My Nvim Config

repo to show my nvim plugins, remappings and all that stuff. Hopefully this repo will be merge to a dotfiles repo at some point.

This config allows a basic version of bootstraping. However, the first time you run this it will throw a bunch of errors(just let the plugins to be installed). The second time some other plugins will finish installing and then all will be loaded correctly. I'll try to fix that later.
